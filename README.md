# Dashboards data ingestion scripts for Digital Transformation Department

Scripts to collect data from different, external sources and store them in a
MongoDB database.

Also contains `italian_regions.geojson`, used as a custom region map in our
production instance of Metabase.

## How to build and test the scripts

To build the local test environment run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

> NOTE: you can set environment variables in the `.env` file. See `.env.example`.

While the ingestion scripts are called on a regular basis in production, in this
test environment they need to be called manually, so that some test data can be
manually sourced and injected into MongoDB (see how in the paragraphs below).

Once the build process is complete, the Metabase dashboard can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

>NOTE: the `/data` folder contains dummy data, useful to be able to carry out tests.

To bring down the test environment and remove the containers use

```shell
docker-compose down
```
